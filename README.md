This script will help you migrate from CocoaPods to SPM by _helping_ you convert your `Podfile.lock` into a `Package.swift`. Keep in mind that this script will only get you 90% there, the remaining 10% will most likely require some manual massaging, as this script is not bullet proof â€” there are always private repos, or repos that don't support SPM yet, or other things that get on the way that prevent the final `Package.swift` from fully working out-of-the-box.

## Installation

None.

## Usage

First, navigate to the directory where your `Podfile.lock` is in. Then run:

```sh
ruby <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogerluan/SPMify/main/spmify.ruby)
```

This will produce the resulting `Package.swift` in the same directory. Now review the `Package.swift` file, and check out the potential TO-DOs that the script left in your file.
